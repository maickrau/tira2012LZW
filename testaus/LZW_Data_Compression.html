<p><em>Thanks to Jan Hakenberg for correction of a couple of errors! In 
Figure 4, the values for new table entries 259 and 265 were truncated.</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks to David Littlewood for pointing out the missing line of pseudocde in Figure 6.</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks to Joe Snyder for pointing out a line where a macro should replace a hard-coded constant.</em></p>
<p>Any programmer working on mini or microcomputers in this day and age 
should have at least some exposure to the concept of data compression.  
In MS-DOS world, programs like ARC, by System Enhancement Associates, 
and PKZIP, by PKware are ubiquitous. ARC has also been ported to quite a
 few other machines, running UNIX, CP/M, and so on.  CP/M users have 
long had SQ and USQ to squeeze and expand programs.  Unix users have the
 COMPRESS and COMPACT utilities.  Yet the data compression techniques 
used in these programs typically only show up in two places:  file 
transfers over phone lines, and archival storage.</p>
<p>Data compression has an undeserved reputation for being difficult to 
master, hard to implement, and tough to maintain.  In fact, the 
techniques used in the previously mentioned programs are relatively 
simple, and can be implemented with standard utilities taking only a few
 lines of code.  This article discusses a good all-purpose data 
compression technique: Lempel-Ziv-Welch, or LZW compression.</p>
<p>The routines shown here belong in any programmer's toolbox. For 
example, a program that has a few dozen help screens could easily chop 
50K bytes off by compressing the screens.  Or 500K bytes of software 
could be distributed to end users on a single 360K byte floppy disk.  
Highly redundant database files can be compressed down to 10% of their 
original size.  Once the tools are available, the applications for 
compression will show up on a regular basis.<br>
<span id="more-3"></span></p>
<h4>LZW Fundamentals</h4>
<p>The original Lempel Ziv approach to data compression was first 
published in in 1977, followed by an alternate approach in 1978.  Terry 
Welch's refinements to the 1978 algorithm were published in 1984.  The 
algorithm is surprisingly simple.  In a nutshell, LZW compression 
replaces strings of characters with single codes.  It does not do any 
analysis of the incoming text.  Instead, it just adds every new string 
of characters it sees to a table of strings.  Compression occurs when a 
single code is output instead of a string of characters.</p>
<p>The code that the LZW algorithm outputs can be of any arbitrary 
length, but it must have more bits in it than a single character. The 
first 256 codes (when using eight bit characters) are by default 
assigned to the standard character set.  The remaining codes are 
assigned to strings as the algorithm proceeds. The sample program runs 
as shown with 12 bit codes.  This means codes 0-255 refer to individual 
bytes, while codes 256-4095 refer to substrings.</p>
<h4>Compression</h4>
<p>The LZW compression algorithm in its simplest form is shown in Figure
 1.  A quick examination of the algorithm shows that LZW is always 
trying to output codes for strings that are already known.  And each 
time a new code is output, a new string is added to the string table.</p>

The Compression Algorithm<br>
Figure 1<br>
</center><p></p>
<p>A sample string used to demonstrate the algorithm is shown in Figure 
2.  The input string is a short list of English words separated by the 
'/' character. Stepping through the start of the algorithm for this 
string, you can see that the first pass through the loop, a check is 
performed to see if the string "/W" is in the table.  Since it isn't, 
the code for '/' is output, and the string "/W" is added to the table.  
Since we have 256 characters already defined for codes 0-255, the first 
string definition can be assigned to code 256.  After the third letter, 
'E', has been read in, the second string code, "WE" is added to the 
table, and the code for letter 'W' is output. This continues until in 
the second word, the characters '/' and 'W' are read in, matching string
 number 256.  In this case, the code 256 is output, and a three 
character string is added to the string table. The process continues 
until the string is exhausted and all of the codes have been output.</p>

</p></center><p></p>
<p>The sample output for the string is shown in Figure 2 along with the 
resulting string table. As can be seen, the string table fills up 
rapidly, since a new string is added to the table each time a code is 
output.  In this highly redundant input, 5 code substitutions were 
output, along with 7 characters. If we were using 9 bit codes for 
output, the 19 character input string would be reduced to a 13.5 byte 
output string.  Of course, this example was carefully chosen to 
demonstrate code substitution.  In real world examples, compression 
usually doesn't begin until a sizable table has been built, usually 
after at least one hundred or so bytes have been read in.</p>
<h4>Decompression</h4>
<p>The companion algorithm for compression is the decompression 
algorithm. It needs to be able to take the stream of codes output from 
the compression algorithm, and use them to exactly recreate the input 
stream.  One reason for the efficiency of the LZW algorithm is that it 
does not need to pass the string table to the decompression code.  The 
table can be built exactly as it was during compression, using the input
 stream as data. This is possible because the compression algorithm 
always outputs the STRING and CHARACTER components of a code before it 
uses it in the output stream.  This means that the compressed data is 
not burdened with carrying a large string translation table.</p>

The Decompression Algorithm<br>
Figure 3<br>
</center><p></p>
<p>The algorithm is shown in Figure 3.  Just like the compression 
algorithm, it adds a new string to the string table each time it reads 
in a new code.  All it needs to do in addition to that is translate each
 incoming code into a string and send it to the output.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the output of the algorithm given the input created by
 the compression earlier in the article.  The important thing to note is
 that the string table ends up looking exactly like the table built up 
during compression.  The output string is identical to the input string 
from the compression algorithm.  Note that the first 256 codes are 
already defined to translate to single character strings, just like in 
the compression code.</p>

<h4>The Catch</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, the nice simple decompression algorithm shown in Figure 4 is just a little <i>too</i>
 simple.  There is a single exception case in the LZW compression 
algorithm that causes some trouble to the decompression side.  If there 
is a string consisting of a (STRING,CHARACTER) pair already defined in 
the table, and the input stream then sees  a sequence of STRING, 
CHARACTER, STRING, CHARACTER, STRING, the compression algorithm will 
output a code before the decompressor gets a chance to define it.</p>
<p>A simple example will illustrate the point.  Imagine the the string 
JOEYN is defined in the table as code 300.  Later on, the sequence 
JOEYNJOEYNJOEY occurs in the table.  The compression output will look 
like that shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p>A problem<br>
Figure 5<br>
</p></center><p></p>
<p>When the decompression algorithm sees this input stream, it first 
decodes the code 300, and outputs the JOEYN string.  After doing the 
output, it will add the definition for code 399 to the table, whatever 
that may be.  It then reads the next input code, 400, and finds that it 
is not in the table.  This is a problem, what do we do?</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is the only case where the decompression algorithm 
will encounter an undefined code.  Since it is in fact the only case, we
 can add an exception handler to the algorithm.  The modified algorithm 
just looks for the special case of an undefined code, and handles it.  
In the example in Figure 5, the decompression routine sees a code of 
400, which is undefined.  Since it is undefined, it translates the value
 of OLD_CODE, which is code 300.  It then adds the CHARACTER value, 
which is 'J', to the string.  This results in the correct translation of
 code 400 to string "JOEYNJ".</p>

The Modified Decompression Algorithm<br>
Figure 6<br>
</center><p></p>
<h4>The Implementation Blues</h4>
<p>The concepts used in the compression algorithm are very simple -- so 
simple that the whole algorithm can be expressed in only a dozen lines. 
Implementation of this algorithm is somewhat more complicated, mainly 
due to management of the string table.</p>
<p>In the code accompanying this article, I have used code sizes of 12, 
13, and 14 bits.  In a 12 bit code program, there are potentially 4096 
strings in the string table.  Each and every time a new character is 
read in, the string table has to be searched for a match.  If a match is
 not found, then a new string has to be added to the table.  This causes
 two problems.  First, the string table can get very large very fast.  
If string lengths average even as low as three or four characters each, 
the overhead of storing a variable length string and its code could 
easily reach seven or eight bytes per code.</p>
<p>In addition, the amount of storage needed is indeterminate, as it depends on the total length of all the strings.</p>
<p>The second problem involves searching for strings.  Each time a new 
character is read in, the algorithm has to search for the new string 
formed by STRING+CHARACTER.  This means keeping a sorted list of 
strings.  Searching for each string will take on the order of log2 
string comparisons.  Using 12 bit words means potentially doing 12 
string compares for each code.  The computational overhead caused by 
this would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>The first problem can be solved by storing the strings as 
code/character combinations.  Since every string is actually a 
combination of an existing code and an appended character, we can store 
each string as single code plus a character.  For example, in the 
compression example shown, the string "/WEE" is actually stored as code 
260 with appended character E.   This takes only three bytes of storage 
instead of 5 (counting the string terminator).  By backtracking, we find
 that code 260 is stored as code 256 plus an appended character E. 
Finally, code 256 is stored as a '/' character plus a 'W'.</p>
<p>Doing the string comparisons is a little more difficult.  Our new 
method of storage reduces the amount of time for a string comparison, 
but it doesn't cut into the the number of comparisons needed to find a 
match.  This problem is solved by storing strings using a hashing 
algorithm.  What this means is that we don't store code 256 in location 
256 of an array.  We store it in a location in the array based on an 
address formed by the string itself. When we are trying to locate a 
given string, we can use the test string to generate a hashed address, 
and with luck can find the target string in one search.</p>
<p>Since the code for a given string is no longer known merely by its 
position in the array, we need to store the code for a given string 
along with the string data.  In the attached program, there are three 
array elements for each string.  They are code_value[i], prefix_code[i],
 and append_character[i].</p>
<p>When we want to add a new code to the table, we use the hashing function in routine <span class="inline_code">find_match</span> to generate the correct value of i.  First <span class="inline_code">find_match</span>
 generates an address, then checks to see if the location is already in 
use by a different string.  If it is, it performs a secondary probe 
until an open location is found.</p>
<p>The hashing function in use in this program is a straightforward XOR 
type hash function.  The prefix code and appended character are combined
 to form an array address.  If the contents of the prefix code and 
character in the array are a match, the correct address is returned.  If
 that element in the array is in use, a fixed offset probe is used to 
search new locations. This continues until either an empty slot is 
found, or a match is found.  By using a table about 25% larger than 
needed, the average number of searches in the table usually stays below 
3. Performance can be improved by increasing the size of the table.</p>
<p>Note that in order for the secondary probe to always work, the size 
of the table needs to be a prime number.  This is because the probe can 
be any integer between 0 and the table size.  If the probe and the table
 size were not mutually prime, a search for an open slot could fail even
 if there were still open slots available.</p>
<p>Implementing the decompression algorithm has its own set of problems.
 One of the problems from the compression code goes away.  When we are 
compressing, we need to search the table for a given string. During 
decompression, we are looking for a particular code. This means that we 
can store the prefix codes and appended characters in the table indexed 
by their string code.  This eliminates the need for a hashing function, 
 and frees up the array used to store code values.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the method we are using of storing string values 
causes the strings to be decoded in reverse order.  This means that all 
the characters for a given string have to be decoded into a stack 
buffer, then output in reverse order.  In the program here this is done 
in the <span class="inline_code">decode_string</span> function.  Once this code is written, the rest of the algorithm turns into code very easily.</p>
<p>One problem encountered when reading in data streams is determining 
when you have reached the end of the input data stream.  In this 
particular implementation, I have reserved the last defined code, 
MAX_VALUE, as a special end of data indicator.  While this may not be 
necessary when reading in data files, it is very helpful when reading 
compressed buffers out of memory.  The expense of losing one defined 
code is minimal in comparison to the convenience.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>It is somewhat difficult to characterize the results of any data 
compression technique.  The level of compression achieved varies quite a
 bit depending on several factors.  LZW compression excels when 
confronted with data streams that have any type of repeated strings.  
Because of this, it does extremely well when compressing English text.  
Compression levels of 50% or better should be expected. Likewise, 
compressing saved screens and displays will generally show very good 
results.</p>
<p>Trying to compress binary data files is a little more risky. 
Depending on the data, compression may or may not yield good results. In
 some cases, data files will compress even more than text. A little bit 
of experimentation will usually give you a feel for whether your data 
will compress well or not.</p>
<h4>Your Implementation</h4>
<p>The code accompanying this article works. However, it was written 
with the goal of being illuminating, not efficient.  Some parts of the 
code are relatively inefficient. For example, the variable length input 
and output routines are short and easy to understand, but require a lot 
of overhead.  An LZW program using fixed length 12 bit codes could 
experience real improvements in speed just by recoding these two 
routines.</p>
<p>One problem with the code listed here is that it does not adapt well 
to compressing files of differing sizes.  Using 14 or 15 bit codes gives
 better compression ratios on large files, (because they have a larger 
string table to work with), but actually has poorer performance on small
 files.  Programs like ARC get around this problem by using variable 
length codes.  For example, while the value of <span class="inline_code">next_code</span> is between 256 and 511, ARC inputs and outputs 9 bit codes.  When the value of <span class="inline_code">next_code</span>
 increases to the point where 10 bit codes are needed, both the 
compression and decompression routines adjust the code size.  This means
 that the 12 bit and 15 bit versions of the program will do equally well
 on small files.</p>
<p>Another problem on long files is that frequently the compression 
ratio begins to degrade as more of the file is read in.  The reason for 
this is simple. Since the string table is of finite size, after a 
certain number of strings have been defined, no more can be added.  But 
the string table is only good for the portion of the file that was read 
in while it was built.  Later sections of the file may have different 
characteristics, and really need a different string table.</p>
<p>The conventional way to solve this problem is to monitor the 
compression ratio.  After the string table is full, the compressor 
watches to see if the compression ratio degrades.  After a certain 
amount of degradation, the entire table is flushed, and gets rebuilt 
from scratch.  The expansion code is flagged when this happens by seeing
 a special code from the compression routine.</p>
<p>An alternative method would be to keep track of how frequently 
strings are used, and to periodically flush values that are rarely used.
  An adaptive technique like this may be too difficult to implement in a
 reasonably sized program.</p>
<p>One final technique for compressing the data is to take the LZW codes
 and run them through an adaptive Huffman coding filter. This will 
generally exploit a few more percentage points of compression, but at 
the cost of considerable more complexity in the code, as well as quite a
 bit more run time.</p>
<h4>Portability</h4>
<p>The code linked below was written and tested on MS-DOS machines, and 
has successfully compiled and executed with several C compilers. It 
should be portable to any machine that supports 16 integers and 32 bit 
longs in C.  MS-DOS C compilers typically have trouble dealing with 
arrays larger than 64 Kbytes, preventing an easy implementation of 15 or
 16 bit codes in this program.  On machines using different processors, 
such as a VAX, these restrictions are lifted, and using larger code 
sizes becomes much simpler.</p>
<p>In addition, porting this code to assembly language should be fairly 
simple on any machine that supports 16 and 32 bit math. Significant 
performance improvements could be seen this way. Implementations in 
other high level languages should be straightforward.</p>

<h4>Update - September 9, 2007</h4>
<p>Reader David McKellar offers up some source code with the following comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I modified your fine 1989 lzw.c code so it outputs the same as the 
GNU/Linux compress command. Of course, I also made the corresponding 
changes in the expand part of your code.</p>
<p>I made the smallest number of changes possible.  You can diff to see 
what I did. I realize your program is an example program to show the 
concepts but I think it doesn't add to the complexity too much to be 
compress compatible.</p>
<p>I should mention that my changes don't totally support the GNU/Linux 
compress.  The real compress flushes its hash table when it notices the 
ratio goes down.  It changes the bits used for encoding when the table 
is full.  And probably more tricky stuff.  However that is only an issue
 when lzw.c is attempting to read a compressed file. </p>

            <p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>I have one doubt on "If that element in the array is in use, a fixed 
offset probe is used to search new locations. This continues until 
either an empty slot is found, or a match is found, the average is 
usually below 3".<br>
My question is:<br>
Will it be possible that one search will never finish or take a huge 
number of search (infinite loop) to find a new location for some 
unpredictable strings? Any upper bounds on the number of search during 
find_match() given the size of the table? Thanks.<br>

			<div class="author_com_text">
            <p>It isn't possible for the search to never complete - the 
hash table has maybe 10% more slots than will be used - so for example 
if the code size is 14 bits, you only need 16K slots, and the table is 
sized at 18K.</p>
<p>Because the number of slots in the table is a prime number, you are 
guaranteed to eventually visit every slot, meaning sooner or later you 
will hit an empty slot.</p>
<p>As to whether this is an efficient method or nort, all I can say is 
that the original authors of the UNIX compress program who developed 
this strategy though that it was generally efficient, and their tests 
came up with the figure that said no more than three probes were usually
 needed.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert on hashing, so I just used the same algorithm that 
was in that code. I think in general to really know if your hash table 
is performing well you just have to run tests and gather statistics - 
it's difficult to predict in advance what the usage patterns will be.</p>

            <p>The second someone is right, the algorithm popularized by
 PKZip and still used in most "Zip-compatible" compressors is called 
deflate. It is an LZ77 compressor that uses a Huffman compressor on its 
token stream. It was very fast and efficient when it was first used 18 
years ago 9http://www.c10n.info/archives/430) and is still the most 
popular compression algorithm for general purpose work today. LZ77 and 
LZ78, despite the similar names, are completely different from one 
another.</p>

<p>How close is the output of this algo to the Unix compress (LZC?) 
algorithm? Will the output of your 12-bit version generate a file that 
can be restored by 'uncompress'?  I'm looking for code that is 
compatible with the Unix version.  Thanks!</p>

            <p>My code is very close to UNIX compress, but not 
identical. I think the best approach to getting compatibility is, 
unfortunately, to hack the compress source code to get it to do your 
bidding.</p>
<p>If you search long enough on the net, you might be able to find the 
UNIX compress algorithm as implemented long ago by the ARC archiver - 
that source should still be compatible but might be a little easier to 
work with.</p>
<p>This might also be answered by one of the experts in comp.compression, you should consider posting the question there.</p>

            <p>Martin, any time you change the integer type from signed 
to unsigned you run the risk of a few bugs. But I'm curious, why would 
you care? If you are on a compiler that uses unsigned 16 bit ints by 
default, you can just change the declaration of all ints in this this 
program to "signed int" and you are free of the problem.</p>
<p>I suspect the hashing probe code will break, but I'm not sure about any of the rest of it.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot.  I compiled your code on Microsoft Visual C
   and it looks like it's running just fine despite the file format I'm 
using.  The expanded file and the original had no differences.  What I'm
 wondering now is what is the integer size of the compressed file?  If 
this sounds like a weird question here's why.  I'm proficient in MatLab 
which as you may or may not know is a lot like C with the biggest single
 exception being the uncompiled execution of code.  I know the basics of
 C but I'm still in the dark about a lot of things.  In order to read 
the compressed file into MatLab, you have to specify the binary type in 
which the files were written (i.e. uint16 = unsigned 16 bit integer, or 
uint8 and so forth).  I hope you know what I'm asking, but thanks for 
the help you've given me already.  I wrote a LZW encoder in MatLab and 
the execution time is at least 100 times that of your code so you may 
have saved me months of execution time.</p>

            <p>Martin, the compressed file is a bit stream organized as 
bytes - so if you are trying to read it in Matlab you are not going to

the way to go.</p>

            <p>I don't have an LZW implementation handy that operates on
 memory, although you could certainly modify this code easily enough - 
no big deal. Since LZW kind of loses out to the much more efficient 
deflate algorithm, maybe you could try zlib, which will easily do what 
you want and do a lot better. If not, start with this source and hack 
it.</p>
<p>To test your question number 2, simply preload the compressor with a 
list of words, then chop those same words off when the output is read. 
If the list of words is chosen carefully, yes, you will see a big 
improvement.</p>
<p>You might also look at my article on star encoding. You could use 
that to preprocess the input, and you'd probably see a big improvement 
there as well.</p>

            <p>What you're talking about is feasible, but what you end up with is not really LZW, it's something else.</p>
<p>To stick with the LZW paradigm and use an external dictionary is not 
too hard. When you are running the compressor, you simply load your 
dictionary file first, which adds the strings to the internal LZW 
dictionary. You then compress the file using the modified dictionary. On
 decompression, you will have to do something similar to load the 
dictionary before processing your compressed data.</p>
<p>Giving up on LZW and doing what you are suggesting is more like star encoding. See my article here for details on that:</p>

for a particular reason I have to store binary data as a basic text-file
 without any bytes being interpreted as control-characters etc.<br>
So I modified your algorithm (MS Access) in order to generate only byte 
values between 32 and 127 (basic ascii) and to store each LZW-code in 2 
bytes (16 bits).<br>
Although at first glance it looks like a poor compression, it's 
comparable with a 13 bits compression with the overhead of storing 13 
bits in 2 bytes. The compression ratio degradation is less than 20%.</p>
<p>Maybe this idea is usefull to others.</p>
<p>Example of a text-based compression:<br>
]~]E]R^w^i^n]4] ]F^i^l^e]V^e^r^s^i^o^n]=]"]4]2]...</p>

            <p>I just compiled your test program and tried it out on an

methods already inherent in the mpeg 2 file. The source file was 17M and
 a huffman compression reduced the size by about 500k. Win rar

            <p>Jabberwocky -</p>
<p>MPEG-2 is already pretty tightly compressed. In general, attempting 
to run a second pass on compressed data is not too productive, so your 
results aren't too suprising. WinRAR has a number of good algorithms, 
most of which are considerably more powerful than LZW, so squeezing an 
extra couple of percent out of the MPEG-2 file is possible.</p>
<p>If you really want to shring the MPEG-2 files, the best way to go 
about it is to transcode them to H.264, in which case you could easily 
shrink them by 50%.</p>

            <p>kiwi, this is just a demonstration program. It does both compression and decompression of a single file. If you enter <em>file.txt</em> as your input, it compresses it to <em>file.lzw</em>, then decompresses it to <em>file.out</em>. You can then compare to make sure the round trip was successful.</p>
<p>If you want a program that just does compression or decompression, it
 should be easy enough to take this program and give it some command 
line options to do just that. But for the purposes of making this 
program illustrate the topics in the article, that wasn't really 
necessary.</p>

            <p>It's possible that you could adapt this code to do GIF encoding and decoding. But it would be a bit of work.</p>

<p>The VIGRA license is pretty reasonable for non-commercial use. </p>
<p>Download vigra1.5.0.tar.gz and look in the source folder for gif.hxx 
and gif.cxx. They've added a framework around it for portability with 
other image codecs, you can strip it out without to much effort.</p>

            <p>Hi, Mark,<br>
I've already written an lzw implementation with Python for my university
 assignment. The biggest trouble was to make it read different length 
symbols, from 2 to 13 bits, as a symbol. Your article is great, and as 
you mentioned, my encoding program is very slow because of searching 
symbols in a 2k-8k dictionary. I dont understand why decoder doesnt need
 hash function.. as if the encoder stores strings in a dictionary at 
hash function indexes, the decoder should make the same dictionary, so 
the indexes are the same for same strings, to decode correctly (because 
compressed file is made from those indexes). Dictionaries must be 
identical, as i understand. then the question is, if the location in the
 dictionary at hash index is used, it jumps some other place for a fixed
 number. but how the decoder should know, if to take the string that is 
in that hash index place, or to jump further and take next string.. your
 program with xor hash and bit operations is to difficult for me to 
understand, i want to make something more simple, but cant understand 
the basics of hashing in this case. maybe you have wrote this in your 
article, but i read several times, and still cant understand why decoder
 doesnt need hashing (im not english speaker), how then should it store 
strings in the dictionary, that indexes match.. sorry for the big post, i
 just wanted to explain everything clearly.<br>

            <p>You don't need to use a hash when decoding. This is 
because the strings are added to a table as sequential indices, and 
because of this are easy to look up directly. For example, if I see a 
code of 258 in the input stream of an encoded LZW file, I just look at 
location 258 in the table to get its definition.</p>
<p>The dictionary is structured different when encoding, which means you
 can't just look up an index. For example, if I want to see if 'A' 
followed by 'B' is in the encoder table, I can't just create an index by
 concatenating'A' and 'B' - this obviously won't work. unless I have a 
16 bit table, which is usually not the case. And that won't work when I 
try to create an entry for "AB"   'C'. I have to combine the string and 
the following in character in some way to create an entry into a smaller
 table, and that's where the hash function comes in.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to compress a text file with LZW, then search 
the compressed text without decompressing it? My idea was to compress 
the keywords with the same dictionary, then do something like a 
Boyer-Moore search, but I'm not sure if (A) it would even work, or (B)

            <p>Ah, you confused me by saying "symbols with 12 bit length." </p>
<p>The LZW.c encodes source text composed of an eight bit alphabet into (by default) 12 bit symbols.</p>
<p>So you are saying that your source text is composed of a 12-bit alphabet.</p>
<p>Yes, you can adapt this program to deal with those words without too 
much trouble, but it will require modifications of the key data 
structures and the hashing algorithm to fit the new size. In addition 
you will obviously need to adjust the input and output routines.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark!<br>
I m a student from India. At first thank u very much for giving a clear 
understanding of the LZW algorithm. I have also seen the source code. 
Though tough, but is understandable. But I m not getting anything about 
the function<br>
"void output_code(FILE *output,unsigned int code)". How u have entered 
the characters into the file using a code buffer? Plz make it clear 4

            <p>The output_code function is a pretty simple piece of code
 that supports the output of tokens in sizes different than the standard
 eight bits.</p>
<p>Most compression algorithms either use a bit stream of some kind or 
write words of varying size, so they are all going to have an 
output_code() routine of some kind. If it doesn't make since to you, I 
suggest you brush up on your C shift and mask operators.</p>

            <p>A good topic for a final year project might be to come up
 with a good implementation of the LZSS algorith, or some other variant 
of LZ77. The classic paper on compression by Ziv and Lempel from 1977 is
 available in illegal copies all over the internet, like here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee398a/resources/ziv:77-SDC.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee398a/resources/ziv:77-SDC.pdf</a></p>
<p>Ziv and Lempel didn't concern themselves too much with 
implementation, so it was many years before programs like PKZip actually
 started using this algorithm.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of an LZ77 ipmlementation is the 
requirement that you look back through previously seen string matches. 
Replacing those matches with pointers is what allows you to achieve 
compression. You can implement a program that does a brute force search,
 but it will be hopelessly slow.</p>
<p>Your assignment, then, would be to create an algorithm to look 
through a bounded window of previously seen text for matches, and 
discuss the various parameters and compromises one must make to get 
reasonable performance.</p>

            <p>Quick note, think there is a small bug in the second pseudocode for decompressing (modified decompression algorithm):<br>
The line:<br>
add OLD_CODE   CHARACTER to the translation table<br>
should be (I believe)<br>
add (translation of OLD_CODE)   character to the translation table</p>
<p>the reason is that OLD_CODE will always be a single character, and if
 there is enough repetition then the string to be added will be more

            <p>Matt,</p>
<p>No, that's not the the way it works. Let's say old_code has a value of 555, and translates to "ABCD".</p>
<p>If you look at the implementation, we definitely store the value 555 
in the translation table, not "ABCD". In LZW.c, old_code is stored in an
 integer array called prefix_table, and the character being appended to 
it is stored in append_character, a character array.</p>
<p>If you look at the decode_string() routine, you'll see how that 
provides enough information to decode any known code. Given a code n, I 
decode it in a loop like this:</p>
<p>string s = "";<br>
while ( n &gt; 255 )<br>
{<br>
    s = append_character[ n ];<br>
    n = prefix_character[ n ];<br>
}<br>
s  = n;</p>
<p>I work my backwards through older and older codes until I finally 
find the original character that started the sequence. String s then 
contains the decoded string, backwards.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,<br>
After few days of sitting above the code, I decided to write here.<br>
My english isn't even good, but I hope that you'll understand me (I'm 16, from Poland).<br>
I'm working on a database project using FLTK and C  .<br>
After closing the main window, app is writing all the data into the file base.txt.<br>
After it, it calls com() function: <a href="http://rafb.net/p/bg7wFK96.html" rel="nofollow">http://rafb.net/p/bg7wFK96.html</a> (It compress the file and delete old base.txt file, leaving just base.lzw).<br>
But my problem is, that not everytime compression is ok, sometimes, last
 few words (or lines), is crashed up. I'm wondering if it's your 
algorithm problem or mine, cause without compression, everything's ok. 
Maybe I missed something ? could you someday remake your LZW source 
code, to use new c   technicues?<br>
Sorry for my post length and a problem. Regards and have a nice day.</p>

<p>In this paper we address the problem of searching in LZW compressed 
text directly, and present a new algorithm for finding multiple patterns
 by simulating the move of the Aho-Corasick pattern matching machine. 
The new algorithm finds all occurrences of multiple patterns whereas the
 algorithm proposed by Amir, Benson, and Farach finds only the first 
occurrence of a single pattern.</p>

            <p>Juan, LZW seems completely inappropriate for processing 
of EEG signals, unless they have been heavily preprocessed, or perhaps 
transfered to the frequency domain. Still, it doesn't really make sense.
 Analog signals such as the EEG are not particulary well served by 
processing with dictionary-based algorithms.</p>
<p>You don't really need to port my code to Matlab, you can get a couple of implementations from Mathworks.</p>

            <p>Gordon, the TABLE_SIZE is the size of the table that 
holds all the tokenized strings. When MAX_CODE is 12 bits, the maximum 
number of entries we will use in the table is 4096. </p>
<p>Because collisions in the hash table reduce its efficiency, we jack 
up the size to be a bit bigger than 4096, which reduces the likelihood 
of a collision. And to top it off, we need the size to be a prime 
number. The probing mechanism needed used in this algorithm is only 
guaranteed to find an empty slot if the table size is prime.</p>
<p>Hashing isn't too complicated, and you can find good explanations of it on the net without too much trouble.</p>

Guess i was being dense and should've realised the MAX_CODE was a prime

            <p>Hi, just wanna say I'm performing a research on LZW vs. Huffman.  Well, i know it's a long issue but anyway I'm still doing it.</p>
<p>You know LZW won't work well with random data.  I actually mean data 
with little repetition.  But if that data has a more frequent characters
 than others it will be well compressed by Huffman.  Just try it with 
pi. you can get a 1 million number of pi from the calgary canterbury 
corpus.</p>
<p>The actual research i was actually doing if i can switch to huffman 
if the data is random and to lzw otherwise.  But it seems i cannot do 
that without reading the file first.  So now my problem is how to detect
 the randomness of a file while i am encoding.</p>
<p>If you want to comment please do so. Thanks.</p>

            <p>You're tackling a difficult problem :-)</p>
<p>Characterizing "randomness" is not easy (not that I'm an expert in 
the area.) My personal bias is to define randomness using a 
pseudo-Kolmogorov Complexity definition, which basically says that you 
define how random a stream is by how well it compresses wrt. a specific 
model. I don't accept the notion that there is an absolute measure of 
randomness.</p>
<p>So, for example, a binary representation of Pi will not compress at 
all with an LZW compressor, and it will not compress at all with an 
order-0 Huffman coder. But does this make it random? Not at all - you 
can write a very simple program with perhaps a couple K characters that 
generates as many digits of PI as you please - resulting in a 
compression ratio of thousands to 1.</p>
<p>In the case you are describing, data with little repetition but a 
strong bias towards certain characters. I think you might be surprised 
if you try to come up with data sets and compare order-0 Huffman and 
LZW. I suspect that their performance tracks one another fairly closely.
 Let's say that a binary file is biased so that it has 50% character 'A'
 and the remaining characters are all randomly distributed. LZW is still
 going to pick up on that by generating codes for all the strings that 
start with 'A' more frequently than other codes.</p>
<p>I think it's a good topic to experiment with - but the first thing 
you have to do is come up with an adequate characterization of 
"randomness", and I think that's the hard part.</p>
<p>Keep us posted!</p>

            <p>Well thanks. and you're right the randomness part is the

            <p>You generally calculate the compression ratio as simply 
output-size/input-size. Thus, perfect compression would give a size of 
0, no compression would give a size of 1. You can also multiply by 100 
to make it a percentage.</p>
<p>Frequently when compressing images, people multiply the compression 
number by the size of a pixel to give a bpP number - bits per Pixel.</p>

<p>There's a neat alternative implementation of the compression 
(data-&gt;code) and decompression (code-&gt;data) tables for in-memory 
compression (where all of the source data and compressed data is 
in-memory simultaneously).  Rather than storing your code-mapped-data 
(your "strings") as either raw data, or a code   character combination, 
you reference an offset/length in your uncompressed data (for the 
compression side) and similarly an offset/length in your decompressed 
data (for the decompression side).  This works because all codes in the 
table map to contiguous data in the uncompressed data, and that when 
decompressing you always output data before adding new codes.</p>
<p>The advantage of doing this is that it makes transcription to/from 
the tables trivial, as it does the equality test for the hash-table 
lookup.</p>

shift the bit buffer right by 24 positions, then output the result.</p>
<p>In effect, it outputs the top byte of that long value.</p>
<p>The C I/O library is oriented around bytes - that is all it knows how to read and write. </p>
<p>The LZW algorithm wants to read and write codes of variable length, generally greater than eight bits.</p>
<p>Because of this, we have to shift the bits into a temporary location 
(output_bit_buffer), then write them out eight bits at a time as the 
buffer fills.</p>
<p>I realize this code might be somewhat confusing, but most libraries 
and languages have no support for bit-oriented I/O, so this is what we 
are stuck with.</p>

            <p>@lehdi:</p>
<p>When you enter the loop OLD_CODE and CHARACTER have the same value, and OLD_CODE has already been sent to the output.</p>
<p>In the first pass through the loop, we then read in a second 
compressed character, which is stored in NEW_CODE. When we try to 
translate it, we will normally succeed, and get a single character 
translation. In the example in the article, we first read '/', and 
output it immediately before entering the loop.</p>
<p>We'll then read 'W', translate that to a string, which will also be "W", and output that. We then add '/' and 'W' to the table.</p>
<p>I recommend walking through the code for a simple example to see how it works.</p>
<p>Also, I am working on an updated version of the article that will 
include much simpler source code. By using modern C++ containers, I can 
implement this so that it's a lot easier to read.</p>

            <p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>Thanks for your code. I have a question about the LZW decoding. Am I 
right that any bit stream can be decoded by the LZW decoder, even 
though, the decoded symbol string is incorrect? For example, if I input 
0000..0, namely, all zero sequences into the decoder. It seems that the 
decoder can still decode it into aa..a, where 'a' is the symbol 
corresponding to index 0 in the table. However, if we encode 'aaa..a', 
the obtained bit stream is not '000..0'. My question is: Is this 
statement right?</p>

<p>No, this definitely not the case. It would be very easy to give the 
LZW decoder an bit stream that it would recognize as being in error. For
 example, if the first symbol decoded by my program had a value of 260, 
it would generate an error.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about this search the comp.compression 
archives for the phrase "bijective." David Scott has invested quite a 
bit of time making various algorithms obey the property you describe

<p>Thanks for your reply. I am thinking how we can find all the bit 
streams that can be detected as en error by the decoder. These bit 
streams can be treated as 'forbidden' bit stream that can be used for 
error detection. I am also thinking whether the initialization or the 
insertion algorithm will affect these 'forbidden' bit streams. If yes, 
we can design a LZW algorithm that has such kind of error detection 
capability. Any comments on that?</p>

            <p>@JT: Two comments on that.</p>
<p>First, check into David Scott's work on bijective coding, as he has been working on similar problems.</p>
<p>Second, I am actually in the middle of an article on forbidden symbol
 usage for error detection in network streams. My particular 
implementation uses an arithmetic coder engine that simply reserves a 
fixed percentage of the symbol space for a special "error" symbol. In 
the case of a transmission error, you will sooner or later bumble into 
the forbidden symbol, with the amount of time varying depending on how 
much symbol space you have carved out for it.</p>
<p>With LZW, the easiest forbidden symbols are those for which we have not yet defined a code.</p>

your code from DDJ was used in our routines to compress graphic images. 
 We used 2 or 3 different compression schemes.  Recently, I came across 
some old files that I have not been able to uncompress.  They don't 
appear to be RLE - looks more like LZW to me.  I tried every piece of C 
code I could find - but alas, I guess that particular code is just gone.
 (it's been 16 years!)  However I DO have 2 sample files that are both 
compressed and uncompressed.  So because I have a 'before and after'

 the other dozen files.  Could you help?</p>

            <p>hi,Mark!<br>
I am using lzw to compress data with Matlab, I do not understand what 
can I do when the dictionary is full, but at the same time the data has 
not compressed fully yet. Should we just reset the dictionary and then 
continue to encoder? If so, when we do decoding, should we reset the 
dictionary too?can we get the right data?</p>

<p>Normally when the dictionary is full you have two choices:</p>
<p>1) Just keep compressing using the dictionary you have. Don't add new phrases, but continue using the old ones. </p>
<p>2) Flush the dictionary completely and start a new one from scratch.</p>
<p>In both cases, the decompressor has to be aware of this behavior, 
normally flagged using a special message. Because there is no LZW 
standard, you are on your own for implementation. </p>
<p>When the dictionary gets full under UNIX compress, it will keep using
 it, but it monitors the compression ratio. If compression starts to 
drop significantly, it drops the dictionary and starts from scratch.</p>

<p>LZW can compress any kind of file, it doesn't matter what the type is.</p>
<p>Reading a file character by character isn't necessarily a bad

            <p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>In the standard LZW, each pointer is encoded using fixed length coding of 12 bits (assuming the dictionary size is 4096). </p>
<p>In GIF, it uses the minimum bits to encode each pointer (e.g. use 9 
bits to encode the pointer '256'). This can be easily understood in the 
sequential insertion, namely, the new string is inserted in a sequential
 manner. However, in hashing-based new string insertion, it seems that 
we cannot use this variable-length coding to encode the pointer. Am I 
right? </p>

<p>JT, I'm not sure I know what you mean. ALL types of LZW build 
libraries with sequential codes that increase as each new string is 
added. It doesn't matter how you store the string table.</p>
<p>UNIX compress provides a nice example of how this works.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I still haven't sat down and worked out how 
they handle the implicit code lengthening when it occurs at just the 
wrong place in the STRING, CHARACTER, STRING, CHARACTER, STRING special 
sequence. I need to work that through, maybe it's not a real problem.</p>

            <p>Let the input symbol sequence be S = s_1s_2...s_M, and the<br>
alphabet size N = 256. Since s_1 can be found in the initial<br>
dictionary, the first pointer I_1 satisfies I_1 \in [0 255]. In<br>
GIF, I_1 is encoded using 8 bits (instead of 12 bits). Then the<br>
new string s_1s_2 in inserted into the 256th entry. Hence, the<br>
next pointer I_2, whatever its valus is, can be encoded using 9<br>
bits. Following similar fashion, the consequent pointer can be<br>
encoded with gradually increasing bits.</p>
<p>However, in hashing-based insertion method, the new string s_1s_2<br>
may be inserted into the 4094th entry for example, which leads to<br>
the fact that the next reference of s_1s_2 has to be represented<br>
using 12 bits. This breaks the gradually increasing length<br>

<p>Well, you must have modified the I/O routines to write to a memory 
instead of a file. I would suggest that you do a sanity check. Compress 
the same data to a file using the original code, then see what the 
contents of test.lzw are.</p>
<p>Next, use your modified code, and perform the compression to an 
array. Now dump the contents of the array and see how it compares to the
 test.lzw from the previous step.</p>

<p>thanks for your prompt reply. I have one more question. This is the problem I faced using an another LZW implementation. </p>
<p>I had an array say:<br>
unsigned char array[5] = { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x00, 0x01};</p>
<p>Now when I compressed and expanded this array, I would loose the 
'0x00' which is between '0x02' &amp; '0x0x'. I was combining two array 
members by converting the unsigned chars to int. When it read 0x00 it 
treated it as 0 and I lost it, and hence the expanding was lossy. </p>

<p>Specifically, when BITS = 9, it occurs on files alice29.txt, 
asyoulik.text, cp.html, fields.c, kennedy.xls, lcet10.txt, and sum. When
 BITS = 10, it occurs on alice29.txt and grammar.lsp. I see no problems 
when compiling with BITS = 11, 12, 13, or 14.</p>
<p>Given my C-challenged status, I haven't been able to track down the 
problem yet. I'm on a a WinXP Pro machine and using MS VC++ 2008 Express
 Edition compiler.</p>
<p>Do you see any such problems when running lzw.c against any of these 
documents compiled for 9- or 10-bit code lengths? Any ideas?</p>
<p>BTW, thanks for a great article!</p>

<p>Yes, the problem is that that the expanded files (in test.out) are 
different from the original files. The expanded files are missing some 
final characters relative to the originals and have the penultimate 
character replicated.</p>

            <p>A quick update to my previous post to correct the record...</p>
<p>Turns out the hexdump tool I was using for debug reported a 
non-existent final character on files being dumped. Thus no "penultimate
 character replication" is occuring in the expanded files as previously 
reported.</p>
<p>However, lzw.c in my environment still eliminates some final 
characters on the indicated files when BITS = 9 or 10.  Seems like a 
buffer isn't being flushed. Perhaps something to do with the hashing 
routine or decode_stack (or my compiler)?</p>

            <p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p> I was willing to implement a LZW compressor/decompressor, and thanks
 to your explainations, I finally managed to make it (or it seems so, I 
still have to test it a bit!).</p>
<p> I looked for a bug for some time, and finally got it. I might be 
wrong, but I think there is something weird in your decompression 
algorithm.<br>
 At line 8, fig 6, you wrote: STRING = STRING + CHARACTER.<br>
 What I did is STRING = STRING + STRING[0] (Like in Wikipedia's decompression algorithm).<br>
 The thing is, CHARACTER gets the value of STRING[0] at line 13, but the
 STRING is 'outputed' at line 12, so the appended char is not the same.</p>
<p> Again, I might be wrong. But this is the problem I had (It might also come from my implementation).</p>
<p> Now I have to take a look at your hashing stuff, it seems very 
interesting! (I'm searching into my string table sequentially at the 
moment).</p>
<p> Thanks again for the post, and excuse my english mistakes, I'm not an english speaker.</p>
<p> PS: Can you make a similar post about adaptative huffman algorithm? (^_^)</p>

<p>Something is wrong, the files should be identical on both systems. 
Keep in mind that the code was posted almost 20 years ago, and compilers
 have changed a bit.</p>
<p>I think step 1 is to actually decode the binary output of the 
compressor and see if it is being properly stored in the file. This is a
 bit painful but it is a great exercise. Start by compressing a very 
short file and it should be relatively easy.</p>

<p>You should probably stop your research - it is not going to work.</p>
<p>In order to compress what you are calling "random" data, a compressor
 must be able to compress *all* input files - not just a select few. 
This is a violation of the counting argument, also known as the 
pigeonhole principle. </p>
<p>A lot of people think they can find a tricky way to beat this 
problem, but it's just not going to happen. The counting argument is so 
exceedingly obvious that there is just no way around it.</p>

            <p>hello guys first of all i would like to thank you for your<br>
laxarious algorithms,<br>
but i want to say a few words on the lzw.c programs,<br>
just both the compression and decompression are written in<br>
one program and after you enter the file to be compressed i don't know where it will put it after it compressed it.</p>
<p>in this time i'm developing an RPC program based on the LZW compression.<br>
this program is going to work as below<br>
1- the compresser program is to be placed on the server and the 
decompresser on the client side then when the client wants to acces any 
file which is found on the server , it will send a request to the server
 with the file name and then the server will reply for the clients 
request by compressing the data using the LZW and then after the client 
will decompress the data and access it.</p>
<p>so can you please send me any suggesion on this thing.<br>

<p>test.lzw is a file that is composed of variable length binary  data, you will not be able to read it.</p>
<p>If you want to see the actual output of the compressor in human

            <p>Hello!<br>
I'm now writing third implementation of LZW algorithm. First was using 
plane array of std::string's as a dictionary with linear search :) That 
was incredibly slow. The second was using binary tree of strings for 
faster search, and it was really much faster. Now I'm implementing hash 
table. I'm not a good programmer, and I can hardly understand your code.
 So, I have a question. My second LZW program (with tree) had better 
compression due to variable output code length: index length grew while 
dictionary was filling (I've wrote a stream class for bitwise file I/O).
 But the same trick with variable index length seems to be impossible 
with hash table. Am I right or wrong?<br>

<p>In almost all data compression, you'll find that the compressor needs
 to operate on the same size units of data that are being used in the 
source input. This is why, for example, files containing say, floating 
point data, do so poorly with general purpose compressors. The 
compressor is looking for correlation between adjacent bytes, when the 
*real* correlation is between longer units.</p>
<p>This is the same problem you are seeing when trying to compress 
two-byte words. The best solution in a case like this is to modify the 
compressor to operate on the full size word instead of input bytes. 
Sometimes this is easy, sometimes not. But if you look around you can 
find sample source code written using various compressors to attack 
different size input streams.</p>

<p>LZW compression works fine on binary files. If you doubt this, create
 a file with one megabyte of nothing but the byte '00', then compress it
 - you will get excellent results.</p>
<p>To almost any general-purpose compressor, there is no concept of 'text' vs. 'binary'. These don't mean anything.</p>
<p>What you are observing is simply the difference between files that are more or less compressible using this method.</p>

<p>Since you are proposing to do the impossible, LZW is as good a choice
 as any other. No algorithm can compress any file to a smaller size.</p>
<p>As far as I know all the LZW patents expired at least two years ago, 
you can use it in any commercial project you like. The deflate algorithm
 is probably a better choice for general-purpose lossless compression, 
but LZW will certainly work.</p>

<p>Great article!</p>
<p>I am trying to implement LZW-12 bit compression such that it is able 
to compress and decompress ASCII as well as binary files. My I/O handler
 reads 8-bits byte as input (program for I/O handler appended), and I 
would like to write the output file in 12bit chunks.</p>
<p>How would I need to vary the algorithm presented by you to accomodate
 these requirements? Will my code have to handle  files that are one or 
two or three bytes in length as individual cases given I am trying to 
write the output file in 12bit chunks?</p>

 make any sense to me. The code as written doesn't distinguish between 
the type of data - as long as it comes in a stream of bytes it's going 
to compress properly.</p>
<p>If you want to write 12 bit chunks you can certainly just use the 
code in the article, which is bit-oriented. Or you can save up two 
12-bit tokens and write them out as a three-byte sequence. This would be
 very efficient but you would have to possibly pad the file with one 
additional token at the end.</p>

            <p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>I'm doing a dissertation in evaluating the compression algorithms. 
When I compiled the code in dev C++ its fine. But when I execute it it 
returns me a file which has got nothing in it. Since I'm not very good 
at code development I'm not able to understand the problem. I wanted to 
know whether this code has any data base connectivity and what shoudl I 
need to do in order to compress a text file. Should I need to change 
anything in the code. Please let me know some basic procedures behind 
this execution. Thank you.</p>

            <p>thanks for this minimal and clear-cut implementation of LZW</p>
<p>i've been trying to adapt your code to use variable bit encoding so as to behave good for both small and large files</p>
<p>I've hit a but in your code which has been mentioned earlier by "jj" when you define BITS (constant) 10 or 9</p>
<p>to reproduce, take your code and add these 2 lines _after_ the definition of the hash table size</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="lc-5"><a href="#" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('c-5'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">C:</span>
<div id="c-5">
<div class="c">
<ol>
<li class="li1">
<div class="de1"><span class="co2">#define BITS 10</span></div>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<div class="de2"><span class="co2">#define MAX_VALUE (1 &lt;&lt;BITS) - 1 </span></div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>this way the hash table will be defined large enough for BITS=14 (any
 value is ok) then you redefine BITS to a lower value to demonstrate the
 bug</p>
<p>for certain kinds of input files, the final file test.out is DIFFERENT from the input file by a couple of bytes near the end</p>
<p>I am certain that the problem is your output_code() implementation 
that for 10 bits and lower isn't guaranteed to flush the final integer 
to the file (despite you writing MAX_VALUE and a zero at the end of your
 compress function).</p>
<p>It is easy to reproduce this bug if you try your code in a few files 
in your %TEMP% folder, I'm sure one of them will fail the test. Or if 
you can't find one I can send you a small test file.</p>

            <p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>I am glad to use your code to compress binary data in PC-based program and it results in great compression power.<br>
However I'm having a problem of not enough RAM to decompress it in a 
small footprint device. Therefore, I'm thinking of hard-coding the 
tables. From my experiment, it seems that compression and decompression 
make use of different tables, i.e. prefix_code, append_character. Do you
 think is it possible to implement fix pattern tables for both 
compression and decompression?<br>
Thank you</p>

<p>Thank you for such a gr8 article on LZw. I t has been really helpful 
for my final year project on data compression. I went through your code 
and i have sum doubts.The code execues for almost all types of text 
files like .txt,.doc,.xls,.rtf etc. Can you please explain which part of
 your code handles the different header formats pertaining to different 
formats of the text files.<br>
I have also developed codes for RLE compression and HUFFMAN compression,
 but they work on only .txt files. How do I modify them to work for all 
formats.<br>
I am also trying to develop a new algorithm. I plan to apply a fixed 
algorithm for 50% of the file, and then depending on the text content i 
want to apply a feasible algorithm. Is this algorithm feasible?</p>

<p>My implementation simply stops adding new strings to the table when it is full. This is probably not optimaly, but it is simple.</p>
<p>If you can find the source code for UNIX compress.c, you will see 
that they monitor the compression ratio of the file after this occurs. 
If the compression ratio starts to drop, they flush the table and start 
over. </p>
<p>Those are probably the only two reasonable options for managing LZW table space.</p>

<p>HASHING_SHIFT is used when creating a hash code. Note that the hash 
code is created by combining the character and its code, mangling them 
together into a single int. One of them is shifted to the left 
HASHING_SHIFT bits before this happens. </p>
<p>For your questions about the bit oriented I/O, all I can say is it is
 pretty straightforward. The variable length bits have to be shifted 
into an integer or byte of some kind before they can be written to the 
file.</p>
<p>I don't know what you are talking about when you say output_code_ORIG. That token does not appear in LZW.C.</p>

            <p>Dear Mark</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and help. I am almost through with the development of the new algorithm i mentioned in my last post. </p>
<p>I have been working on development of another compression technique 
for text files. I propose to replace every new word in the file with a 
special character. Whenever i find a new word in the file i assign an 
index number to it and replace the word with the special character in 
the compressed file and update my dynamic dictionary with the integer 
index,the special character and the word. The next time the word is 
found in the file i replace the word with my defined special character. 
Once the single character replacement is saturated(i.e all the special 
characters from 1-254) are assigned, i concatenate the integers to get 
my new coder- defined special characters for the next 254^2 words and 
the porces continues.</p>
<p>I will be obliged if u comment on the merit of the algorithm i am 
attempting to develop and also suggest ways to optimise the algorithm.

            <p>Dear Mark</p>
<p>Thank You for your reply. I did tally mt results with Lzw results. 
The compression ratio is superior in the range of 5% to 25% depending on
 the content of the file. </p>
<p>Moreover in lzw if we go for an example like : CAT, the first time it
 is coded we need to go for a check for existence of the word aftr every
 letter of the word is read and we continue with the process of 
continuation and finally assign the code equivalent to  Whereas as per 
my implementation i just assign one special character to it(depending on
 the index assigned i.e if the index value is 2 i assign char(2) to the 
word), which not only saves my computation time and also increases my 
compression ratio.</p>
<p>I will be obliged if you kindly see whether my thought process is 
correct and would like to know where my logic of implementation might be
 wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark</p>
<p>Thanks for this awesome article.<br>
i am developing an algorithm where the dictionary size is kept 
4096.Whenever it becomes full then some entries will be deleted 
depending on priority basis.If a pattern already exists in the 
dictionary then we increases it's HIT factor.The patterns which have 
lowest HIT will be deleted.If 2 or more have same HIT but length is 
different then the pattern with smallest length will be deleted.If 2 or 
more have same HIT and length is also same then the pattern which enters
 first in the dictionary will be deleted.this is the synopsis.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me whether it is a previous work or not?I went 
through several books but can not find this approach.Also may I use your
 sample program for modification.waiting for your reply.Thanks in 
advance.</p>

<p>I am not sure that this is a very good idea with LZW. In fact, I'm not sure you can do it feasibly.</p>
<p>Just as an example, if you decide to remove the string for "ax", you 
will also have to delete all strings built on "ax", including "axi", 
"axia", "axial", etc. </p>
<p>To avoid this problem you will have to completely redo the way LZW stores its dictionary.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you will also have to synchronize the dictionary management between the compressor and decompressor.</p>
<p>As for whether this has been done before, I don't know.</p>

Checking the HIT count of all 4096 patterns and using the HIT count 
shall I not be able to delete a single pattern every time the dictionary
 becomes full?<br>
Suppose we have various entries such as "ax","axi","axial","axials" 
etc.May I not be able to delete only "ax" at a time?Can you plz 
recommend any suitable approach for doing this?<br>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>I came acorss this site and gone through a lot of the discussion. 
Find very useful and thanks. I have a question - and not sure if you can
 help me. </p>
<p>I have to do LZW comprssion as part of my college project for image 
processing. After a lot of confusion and trying, I finally understand 
the algorithm. I have written a java code which works for Strings (i 
would say probably not efficiently), however to work with pixels, I need
 it to work in Bytes / or Ints. My issues is how do I parse through 
bytes / ints and concatinate them to build dictionary? Say if I have 1 
12 3, LZW works on Stream of 1123 and building the dictionary from 
there. Any hint - I am using Java - and any help to nudge me in the 
right direction is appreciated.</p>

<p>The code already reads in bytes, so you don't have to do anything different for that. </p>
<p>To read integers you probably should just use DataInputStream and 
call the ReadInt() method. The LZW code will require a fairly large 
amount of modifications though. The library is currently built around 
chars and you will need to modify it to build entries using integers.</p>

<p>1) code_value could be unsigned just as easily as signed, it wouldn't
 make any difference. In fact, it is probably better for it to be an 
unsigned integer. But this would only be an issue if we were building 
code tables that used all 16 or 32 bits, and in this code we are not.</p>
<p>2) The main difference is that the UNIX implementation starts with 9 bit code values and bumps them up implicitly.</p>
<p>3) This program does not flush the table, it simply stops adding new codes.</p>

            <p>Sir, i went through your site, and your code. This topic 
appears more like 'Mark Nelson's' compression, than Lzw compression! But
 i am not clear with the following issues. Kindly draw some light on 
them.</p>
<p>1.what is the reason for using unsigned EOF in compress()?</p>
<p>2.What is the logic behind this hash function? Is it the most efficient, or could it be replaced by any such formula</p>
<p>3. In decmpress(), string has the translation in reverse. In order to
 equate the 'first character' of 'string' to 'character', shouldnt we 
use the last letter of 'string'?</p>

<p>1) EOF needs to be case to unsigned due to C semantics. After getc() 
assigns its value to character, whatever was returned is now unsigned. 
Thus, the comparison needs to be to an unsigned value.</p>
<p>2) The hash function is fairly efficient, it is very simple. But if I
 were writing this code today, I would simply use a C++ hash table and 
use the default hashing function. I am using the function that was used 
in UNIX compress something like 25 years ago when memory was dear and 
CPU cycles were expensive.</p>
<p>3) I'm not sure about this, but since the code works properly, I 
suggest examination inside a debugger to satisfy your curiosity.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
I'm trying to write an LZ78 compressor/decompressor for an university project, and I found your very helpful code!<br>
Anyway, I still can't figure out how to decompress the encoded file without having the hashtable already built in memory.<br>
Your program encode the input file, and then decode the intermediate 
file using the same already-compiled data structure, doesn't it?<br>
But, what if I split the 2 functionalities (encode, decode) into 2 
programs running in different data space (or 2 instances of the same 
program with a switch on command line arguments)? Does the decode 
function itself decompress correctly the input stream, or it uses the 
data stored by compress function?</p>

<p>You can split my program into two pieces - it most definitely does not need the hash table when decoding.</p>
<p>The LZW algorithm builds the hash table as it reads tokens in the 
encoded data stream. The characters get added to the table in the same 
order they do when the encoder runs.</p>
<p>Read the article again and try working it out by hand, you will see 
that the table is most definitely not used or needed by the decoder.</p>

            <p>Standard I/O functions for reading and writing to files generally only read and write 8-bit bytes.</p>
<p>When writing compression code, we frequently need to write codes that
 are not exact multiples of 8 bits in length. In this program, we write 
codes that are 12 bits. </p>
<p>The output_code() and input_code() functions accomplish this. For 
example, when we are going to write 12 bits to the output file, we first
 eight bits of the code to the file. We then have four bits more that 
need to be output, but since that does not constitute a full byte, we 
will combine it with the first four bits of the next code to be output.</p>
<p>In order to understand how the function works, you need to understand
 the format of binary data, and the C operators used to manipulate them.
 Study the code and try running it on some test data and it should all 
become clear sooner or later.</p>

<p>Your multimedia files have already been compressed. Data in MP3, MP4,

squeeze a little bit more space out of them with a really good algorithm
 like deflate, but often they are just not compressible.</p>

compress() and expand() to compress from one specified character

However, I find that if I compress a same string and expand it twice,

I memset zero to those global memory vars before compressing. Why does it happen?  Anything don't I concern?</p>

<p>When I created this program, it was designed to run one time - I 
didn't try to make a library component that could be reused. There are 
many places things could go wrong if you try to run the compressor 
twice, so you are going to have to keep looking.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark sir,<br>
   I have implemented LZW algorithm in MATLAB.  I have  transformed the 
message file (say 1MB) to a coding table of code words(1.4MB) and a 
table of indexes(50KB) which points to position of the code word in 
decompressed file. I want to send the compressed data i.e Indexes file

<p>Codes are integer values, which mostly start at 256 or 257 and increase montonically.</p>
<p>Strings are sequences of bytes.</p>
<p>So the assignment you propose doesn't work - it is assuming some kind

            <p>How does that work with line 8 then?  "add OLD_CODE + CHARACTER to the translation table"</p>
<p>OLD_CODE needs to be a string in this context, no?  Sure seems like 
what you want is the old string value in this case, not the old 
(unresolved) lookup code.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn't get a chance to address this properly until today - I was traveling.</p>
<p>First, I think using pseudocode was a bad idea on my part, but it was a long time ago, and that was a different me.<br>
I've got an updated version of the article that I think is a lot more 
trustworthy, and it only uses C++ code - no pseudocode. The decompress 
routine looks like this:</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="lc-9"><a href="#" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('c-9'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">C:</span>
<div id="c-9">
<div class="c">
<ol>
<li class="li1">
<div class="de1"><span class="kw4">unsigned</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> code;</div>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<div class="de2">&nbsp; <span class="kw4">unsigned</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> next_code = <span class="nu0">257</span>;</div>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<div class="de1">&nbsp; <span class="kw1">while</span> <span class="br0">(</span> in&gt;&gt; code <span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span></div>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; out &lt;&lt;strings<span class="br0">[</span>code<span class="br0">]</span>;</div>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kw1">if</span> <span class="br0">(</span> previous_string.<span class="me1">size</span><span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">)</span></div>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<div class="de2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strings<span class="br0">[</span>next_code++<span class="br0">]</span> = previous_string + strings<span class="br0">[</span>code<span class="br0">]</span><span class="br0">[</span><span class="nu0">0</span><span class="br0">]</span>;</div>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; previous_string = strings<span class="br0">[</span>code<span class="br0">]</span>;</div>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<div class="de2">&nbsp; <span class="br0">}</span> </div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
In this case, previous_string is a standin for OLD_CODE, and it does exactly what you are saying it should do.</p>
<p>In the pseudo code, I am very casually going back and forth between 
strings and codes, which is a confusing mistake. So when I say OLD_CODE =
 NEW_CODE, I am doing so on the idea that NEW_CODE == STRING. Which it 
is, more or less, if you look up NEW_CODE in the library, you get 
STRING.</p>
<p>In any case, your correction is well taken, and as I say, I think the
 whole thing is a lot more clear and less prone to misinterpretation in 
the new article at:</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I want to use this algorithm for image compression. For calculation of 
compression rate, Is it necessary to find size of packed array and then 
compare it with original size of image?</p>
